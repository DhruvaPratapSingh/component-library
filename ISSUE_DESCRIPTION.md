## **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

Currently, several components in the library lack proper accessibility features, making them difficult or impossible to use for people with disabilities. Specifically:

1. **DatePicker Component**:
   - Uses inline styles instead of CSS classes
   - Lacks proper labeling associations
   - Missing ARIA attributes for required fields
   - No semantic HTML for date representation

2. **Accordion Component**:
   - Limited keyboard navigation support
   - Missing ARIA roles and attributes
   - No semantic HTML structure
   - Poor focus management

3. **ProgressBar Component**:
   - Basic ARIA implementation
   - No support for custom labeling
   - Missing comprehensive ARIA attributes

4. **Button Components**:
   - Lack of ARIA attributes for accessibility
   - No support for aria-label or aria-describedby
   - Limited focus state visibility

## **Describe the solution you'd like**

Enhance these components with proper accessibility features:

### DatePicker Component
- Replace inline styles with CSS classes
- Add proper `htmlFor` association between label and input
- Add ARIA attributes for required fields
- Improve focus states with visible indicators
- Add semantic `<time>` element for date display
- Add PropTypes validation

### Accordion Component
- Add comprehensive keyboard navigation (Arrow keys, Home, End)
- Add proper ARIA roles (`region`, `button`)
- Add `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, and `aria-labelledby` attributes
- Improve focus management with visible focus indicators
- Add semantic HTML structure with proper heading levels
- Add PropTypes validation

### ProgressBar Component
- Add comprehensive ARIA attributes (`aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`)
- Add support for `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby`
- Improve labeling options
- Add PropTypes validation

### Button Components
- Add `aria-label` and `aria-describedby` support
- Improve disabled state styling
- Enhance focus states with visible indicators
- Add PropTypes validation

## **Describe alternatives you've considered**

1. **Using existing accessibility libraries**: This would add unnecessary dependencies to the project
2. **Keeping components as-is**: This would exclude users with disabilities from using the library
3. **Complete rewrite with TypeScript**: This would be a much larger undertaking and outside the scope of this issue

## **Additional context**

These improvements will make the component library compliant with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards and more inclusive for users with disabilities. The changes follow React and accessibility best practices and will not break existing functionality.

This is a good first issue for Hacktoberfest contributors who want to learn about accessibility in React components.
