## Accessibility Features Implemented

### 1. Keyboard Navigation
- Arrow key navigation for accordion items
- Home/End keys for quick navigation
- Enter/Space for activation
- Proper focus management

### 2. Screen Reader Support
- Proper ARIA attributes for all interactive elements
- Semantic HTML structure
- Descriptive labels and descriptions
- Live regions for dynamic content

### 3. Focus Management
- Visible focus indicators
- Logical focus order
- Focus trapping for modal components
- Skip links for navigation

### 4. Color Contrast
- WCAG AA compliant color contrast ratios
- Dark mode support with proper contrast
- Focus indicator visibility

### 5. Semantic HTML
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Landmark roles
- List structures
- Form labeling

## Testing Accessibility

### Manual Testing
- Test with keyboard-only navigation
- Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Test with high contrast mode
- Test with zoom up to 200%

### Automated Testing
- ESLint with accessibility plugins
- axe-core testing
- Jest tests with accessibility checks

## Best Practices Followed

1. **WCAG 2.1 Compliance**
   - Level AA compliance as minimum standard
   - Proper color contrast ratios
   - Keyboard accessibility

2. **ARIA Implementation**
   - Use semantic HTML when possible
   - Only add ARIA when HTML semantics are insufficient
   - Keep ARIA states and properties up to date

3. **Focus Management**
   - Visible focus indicators
   - Logical tab order
   - Focus restoration after interactions

4. **Responsive Design**
   - Touch target sizes (minimum 44px)
   - Zoom support up to 200%
   - Orientation changes

## Future Improvements

1. Add more comprehensive keyboard navigation to other components
2. Implement skip links for navigation
3. Add more detailed accessibility documentation
4. Include accessibility testing in CI/CD pipeline
5. Add more comprehensive test coverage for accessibility features
