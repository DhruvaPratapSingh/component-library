# Add Comprehensive Unit Test Coverage for All Components

## Description

This PR adds comprehensive unit test coverage for all components in the library that were previously missing tests. The goal is to improve code quality, prevent regressions, and make it easier for contributors to understand component behavior.

## Changes

### New Test Files Added

- **Button Components**: 11 new test files for button components
- **Feedback Components**: 2 new test files for feedback components
- **Card Components**: 11 new test files for card components
- **Loader Components**: 4 new test files for loader components
- **Navigation Components**: 4 new test files for navigation components
- **Tooltip Components**: 2 new test files for tooltip components
- **Input Components**: 3 new test files for input components
- **Other Components**: 4 new test files for other components

### Configuration Files Added

- `jest.config.js` - Jest configuration
- `jest.setup.js` - Jest setup file
- Updated `package.json` with test scripts
- `TESTING.md` - Comprehensive testing guide
- `TEST_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of all test coverage

### Test Coverage

This PR adds test coverage for 35 components that previously had no tests, bringing the total test coverage to 100% of all components in the library.

## Testing

All tests pass successfully. You can run the tests with:

```bash
npm test
```

Or in watch mode:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Code Quality**: Tests ensure components work as expected
2. **Regression Prevention**: Catch breaking changes before they're merged
3. **Better Documentation**: Tests serve as documentation for component behavior
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes can be made with confidence
5. **Contributor Onboarding**: New contributors can understand component behavior through tests

## Test Structure

All tests follow best practices:
- Use React Testing Library for realistic component testing
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Test both functionality and styling
- Include accessibility tests
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Cover edge cases and error states
